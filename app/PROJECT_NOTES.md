# Project Overview
Kinship: Your Church Family, Connected
The Problem
Your congregation has incredible untapped resources:

Skills, tools, vehicles, expertise
People willing to helpâ€”if they knew who needed it
Desire for deeper communityâ€”but no clear path

Everything flows through overwhelmed pastoral staff.
The Solution
Kinship is a private community platform that:
Automates coordination

Life events trigger support (baby â†’ meal train, moving â†’ notify helpers)
Smart reminders and follow-ups
Old posts auto-archive

Enables discovery

Searchable member directory (skills, interests, assets)
"Who has a truck?" "Who's a realtor?" "Who loves biking?"
Hidden resources surface (Mike has an excavator!)

Strategic deployment

Admins target specific groups
"Moving help needed â†’ notify teen parents"
"Elderly member needs help â†’ ping youth group"

Positive-only culture

Helpers earn kudos (no negative ratings)
Anonymous posts to pastoral staff for sensitive issues
Grace-filled by design

Why Churches Love It
âœ“ Reduces staff workload (autopilot coordination)
âœ“ Increases engagement (passive members participate)
âœ“ Deepens community (meaningful connections)
âœ“ Measurable impact (dashboard shows what's working)
âœ“ Multi-campus support (filter by location)

ðŸŽ¯ Strategic deployment - Admins can target teens, truck owners, specific groups
ðŸŽ¯ Hidden resources - "Wait, Mike has an excavator?!"

ðŸŽ¯ Engagement metrics - Dashboard shows 89% engagement rate

# Current Status
Previously we completed the full member directory and an assets directory and we were working on the interactive meal train calander with a full needs board coming after that. this was all within a demo that we will later push to a working version after I get a killer demo working. 
# Next Goals
Each church should have its own instance, with the ability to have notations/ filters to accommodate multiple campuses. I.E. Filter out events happening at the sister campus across the city and only show events at my local branch.
Church staff and/ or approved mods. Theres no reason for church staff to have to add an extra thing on their plate if they don't want to.
Not sure. I want to provide enough utility that is un obtrusive cost wise and useful enough that they would want to foot the bill. we could go any number of ways. Perhaps an honor based system wherein they pay a small percentage of their total income on an honor based system, which would occasionally get audited and billed for any discrepancies. Basically I think the vast majority of churches would be good for their word and if not then an audit might sort it out. perhaps 0.5 percent of monthly incoming money, that way no mater how faithful the congregation is with giving its never going to be too much of a burden on the church as a whole.
Pretty granular? The whole point is to put yourself out there to some extent to offer services, assets, skills, needs, and make yourself available. but you could say something for example, I have a box truck and can help people move, but not share that you are a carpenter by trade.
Perhaps just some disclaimer that states if you seek a professional service with someone that it is at your own risk. It would be the same if someone posted on facebook. you dont have to go with them. you can look up say a google business profile and make your own determination. Theres a level of expected due diligence.

Trust and safety, community building features, practical helper, family & life and probably the gamification part. Additionally, lets add an ability to post anonymously when posting requests for sensitive issues so a pastor or Mod can reach out. I love the verified badges part. Really all of it sounds good.

My goal is the ability to truly network. Reduce friction as much as possible. I want it to be easy and enjoyable for even someone who is not so interested in engaging with it to be engaged.
I want it to allocate and aggregate tasks to the congregation and make it easy for the Church to provide networking. To allow medium to large churches to 'fire on all cylinders' easier. Rather than reaching out to a pastor to seek help with meals after childbirth, there could be people ready and willing to help with that as soon as someone uploads an expected due date, for example.
I like the idea of being able to build up your profile over time and give props to others but not necessarily RATE others. (*Notification* You posted you needed help moving last week. Did anyone who responded come and help?" *response* Billy showed up to help us move. Bob didnt" *Billy gets a point, kudo or whatever towards his profile, no negative impact om bob*, etc)
this would all require a pretty (I suspect) robust automatic notification delivery system/ housekeeping within the app to keep things running smoothly. Constant updates would be needed and old posts would need to be archived I guess. We can work on branding later.
Couple things to add, in no particular order...
 Lets allow admin to reach out and make custom connections, nudges to specific people/ groups (someone needs help moving lets get the teenage boys involved -> notify their parents to rope them in etc...)
 lets  have a spot for physical assets. Example: I have the following (Vehicles) a truck, a trailer, a kubota tractor and a mini excavator.  OR I have a full service print shop. etc...
 Meal trains automatically create a calendar that people can RSVP a spot to provide a meal in. And the owner or admin can select what meals are actually needed (Just dinner, all three meals etc)
